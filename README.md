### 🚀 Some of My Projects

- **[From Jupyter Notebooks to OOP Machine Learning Projects](https://github.com/tntath/notebooks-to-oop-simple-gan)**: I refactored a single Jupyter Notebooks into object oriented code in Python, so that it can be used in real products.
- **[ToDo list API with FastAPI](https://github.com/tntath/todo-app-fastapi)**:  An API for a ToDo list app as a part of a coding challenge. I used FastAPI as the main framework, Postgres for its databse, and Docker to con- tainerize them.
- **[Github API assistant](https://github.com/tntath/api-assistant)**: An LLM based assistant that answers questions related to the [Github API](https://github.com/github/rest-api-description/blob/main/descriptions/api.github.com/api.github.com.json). I used FastAPI as the main framework, FAISS for semantic search, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model as the LLM.
- **[Hotel Reservation Application in Java](https://github.com/tntath/hotel-reservation)**: A Java application with a command line interface that enables a user to create an account, check the available rooms, and make a Reservation
